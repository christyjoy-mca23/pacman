This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a simple Pac-Man animation that moves Pac-Man left and right within a specified container.

### Code Description:
- The HTML file sets up a container (`#container`) and an image (`#pac-right`) of Pac-Man.
- The CSS file styles the container and Pac-Man image, setting their dimensions, positioning, and appearance.
- The JavaScript code defines a `move()` function to animate Pac-Man's movement back and forth within the container. This function is called repeatedly using `setInterval()`.

### Future Improvements:
- Make the Pac-Man animation smoother by using CSS transitions or animations.
- Allow Pac-Man to move in multiple directions (e.g., up, down, left, right) based on user input.

### How to Run the Code:
To run the code:
1. Save the HTML, CSS, and images (PacMan1.png, PacMan2.png, PacMan3.png, PacMan4.png) in the same directory.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to see the Pac-Man animation.

Ensure that the image paths in the `<img>` tags (`src="PacMan1.png"`, etc.) are correct and point to the actual image files in your directory. Adjust the paths accordingly if needed.
